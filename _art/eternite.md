## Introduction to <i>Éternité</i>
Éternité is a unique indie escape game that involves solving arithmetic and logic puzzles that are built upon a romance story. There are different difficulty levels to play and completing each difficulty will result in a different ending.

This game was built as a project for the course 50.002 Computation Structures in SUTD, where we were expected to use Mojo, Lucid & Hardware to make a game. The cool part of our game is unlike most of the other games, it is able to live on in other mediums, without the hardware. I'm planning to make a web version of the game in near future.

## Design Process
### The Name of the Game
The theme of Eternity came about from the counting of Binary numbers, and that it is supposedly the most romantic thing for couples to swear eternity to each other.

<i>Éternité</i> is the french version of <i>Eternity</i>, but also because it links to the endings that the players could get.

### Character Design
Since this was our story, we wanted to draw out our own character as well. As I doddle mostly in anime style, Ana also had a similar style.
I wanted Ana to look lifeless, sad and beautiful, and feel as if she is longing for something.
I drew her to be holding onto red Salvia flowers as they have a similar representation of her possessive feelings - "Forever Mine".

### Poster Design
One of my group mates, Nath, gave me a reference poster for inspiration. It was a Fate/StayNight poster. He shared it with me because he remembered that the girl protagonist in this poster is also a <i>yandere</i> like Ana. I really like the vibe of innocence that radiates from menacing background behind the girl, but the story settings are slightly different. Our story has a slightly darker feel to it. So i chose an abandoned house background and added a satin effect to Ana.

Designing this poster itself didn't take a long time as I already knew how I wanted to present the game to the public.
