    title: "Anime. Manga."
    excerpt: "Some genres that I enjoy watching are psychological thrillers, romance, and comedy. My favourite anime up till now is still Boku no Hero Academia, as I am really inspired by the character design of the protagonist, Deku. His name represented the will of being able to do things and his actions live up to his name. I've made a poster that has a feature on him as well for Japan-nice Exhibition 2018 in SUTD, check it out!"

  excerpt: "I am not proficient in drawing, but I enjoy translating my thoughts into visuals on paper. Last year, I had a chance to be part of an Urban Sketching course in my school that is led by Urban Sketchers Singapore. It was really fun to go around different places in Singapore to just sit there, and draw out the scenery."
