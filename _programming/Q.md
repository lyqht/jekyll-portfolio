## About this project
Q is a queue management app utilizing Firebase features such as Firebase Authentication, Data storage, User Management System & Recyclerview. It is made as a project for the course 50.001 Information Systems & Design, where we learn and apply java concepts and android development basics. We also showcased this project during the ISTD Exhibition 2018.

## Purpose of App
Q serves to eliminate the problem of physical queues by implementing a user-friendly interface for users to find, join and create queues easily. Similar to Carousell, our Q system allows users to be both customers and merchants.

This app was made within a week with limited amount of time for learning, so we did not manage to achieve a lot of the features that we wanted. It was still a great learning experience for me, as it was my first time coding with a team of 6 using Git.

## The Problem of Physical Queues
Queues are a common sight in the much land-deprived Singapore. They are a source of psychological discomfort and unproductivity.

With the ageing population of Singapore, the elderly will also be present in ever greater numbers. It is troubling for the elderly to queue for long periods while standing or sitting and remaining stationary in their spot. For very long physical queues, there will be crowd control costs incurred.

For restaurants and cafes, where it tends to be very packed, there is a high risk of knocking onto people carrying fragile stuff or hot food, and this could be dangerous. For crowded canteens or food courts, there are also chances of mixing up the queues for adjacent stores to join for the customers. This can be applied to ad-hoc events as well, where they have different queues for different purposes but are put next to each other.

## Possible areas of application of our app
1. Healthcare
2. Food & Beverages
3. Airport Customs
4. Customer Service Counters
5. Once-off Events
   - Goodie Bag Distribution
   - Gift Packaging
6. Anything with queues!
